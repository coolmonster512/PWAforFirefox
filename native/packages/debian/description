Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web apps that use web APIs and features along
with progressive enhancement strategy to bring a native app-like user
experience to cross-platform web applications. Although Firefox supports many
of Progressive Web App APIs, it does not support functionality to install them
as a standalone system app with an app-like experience.

This project creates a custom modified Firefox runtime to allow websites to be
installed as standalone apps and provides a console tool and browser extension
to install, manage and use them.

This package contains only the native part of the FirefoxPWA project. You
should also install the browser extension if you haven't already. You can
download it from <https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/firefoxpwa/>.
