    <summary>A tool to install, manage and use Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in Mozilla Firefox (native component)</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[
**A tool to install, manage and use Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in Mozilla Firefox.**

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web apps that use web APIs and features along with progressive enhancement strategy to bring a native app-like user experience to cross-platform web applications. Although Firefox supports many of Progressive Web App APIs, it does not support functionality to install them as a standalone system app with an app-like experience.


This project creates a custom modified Firefox runtime to allow websites to be installed as standalone apps and provides a console tool and browser extension to install, manage and use them.

## Features

* Command-line tool to install, manage and run Progressive Web Apps in Firefox.
* Extension to set up native programs, and install, manage and run PWAs and their profiles directly from the main Firefox browser.
* Isolated Firefox installation and profile(s) that stores the PWAs.
* Installed PWAs have their own start/app menu entry and taskbar icon, and live in their own window.
* Installed PWAs have tabs and address bar for a better app-like feel.
* Support for installing all websites as Progressive Web Apps.
* Support for all Firefox addons/extensions and built-in Firefox features.
* Support for automatic (user-triggered) installation and patching of installation and profile(s).

## Notes

* This package contains only the native part of the FirefoxPWA project. You should also install the browser extension if you haven't already. You can download it from the [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/firefoxpwa/) website.
* This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
