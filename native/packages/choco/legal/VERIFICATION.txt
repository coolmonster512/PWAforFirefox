VERIFICATION

I am the author of the PWAs for Firefox project.

Both Windows installers are built automatically on every release using GitHub Actions from
the project source, published as workflow artifacts, and then added to a new GitHub release.
After the installers are built, another automated script downloads installers from artifacts
automatically updates the version in the `.nuspec` file, calculates installer checksums and
saves them into this file, and publishes a new version to Chocolatey.

Installer checksums can be verified by downloading MSI installers from the correct GitHub
release on the repository, generating their SHA-256 checksums (for example, using sha256sum),
and comparing them to the checksums provided below.

The source for building and publishing process can be found in the GitHub Actions workflow
file for the native component in the GitHub repository.
