Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web apps that use web APIs and features along
with progressive enhancement strategy to bring a native app-like user
experience to cross-platform web applications. Although Firefox supports many
of Progressive Web App APIs, it does not support functionality to install them
as a standalone system app with an app-like experience.

This project modifies Firefox to allow websites to be installed as standalone
apps and provides a console tool and browser extension to install, manage and
use them.
