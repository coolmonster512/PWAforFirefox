# Profile Properties

## Name

A profile name. Displayed in the extension and console.

## Description

A profile description. Displayed in the extension and console.

## Template

A template directory. If specified, all contents of the provided template directory will
be copied to a newly-created profile. This is useful if you want to create a new profile
with the same extensions, settings, etc. as an existing one.

This is not *a real property*. It only exists when creating a new profile and cannot be
changed afterward, as copying from a template is a one-time operation.
