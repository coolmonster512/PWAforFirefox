## About {: style="margin-top:0;" }

[Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)
are web apps that use web APIs and features along with progressive enhancement strategy to
bring a native app-like user experience to cross-platform web applications. Although
Firefox supports many of Progressive Web App APIs, it does not support functionality to
install them as a standalone system app with an app-like experience. This functionality is
often also known as a Site Specific Browser (SSB).

This project creates a custom modified Firefox runtime to allow websites to be installed
as standalone apps and provides a console tool and browser extension to install, manage
and use them.
