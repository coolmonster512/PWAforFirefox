# Privacy Policy

## Extension Privacy Policy

The extension exchanges personal data (current website and manifest URLs, as well as other
PWA details) with the native program when the user initiates the web app installation. This
is necessary in order to correctly obtain and parse the Web Application Manifest and install
the web app. Data are stored on the computer as long as that web app is installed. No personal
data leave the computer or are sent to third parties.

## Runtime Privacy Policy

As installed web apps are running inside a Mozilla Firefox browser, you need to agree to
[the Firefox Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/).

## Website Privacy Policy

**TODO: Write privacy policy for this documentation website (where it is hosted, analytics, etc.)**
