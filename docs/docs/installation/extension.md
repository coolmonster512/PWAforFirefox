# Extension Installation

## From Addon Store

It is recommended to install the extension from [the Firefox Add-ons website][link-addon-store].

## From Development Artifacts

You can download and install [the latest build artifact][link-build-artifact] from GitHub Actions builds.

!!! warning

    These are development versions that may be unstable and are not signed, so you
    will need to configure Firefox to accept non-signed extensions or just load it
    temporarily. It is generally not recommended to use them, unless you are testing
    a specific unreleased feature.

## From Source

You can read the instructions for the installation from source in [the extension README file][link-extension-readme].
