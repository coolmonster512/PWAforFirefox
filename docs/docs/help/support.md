# Getting Support

If you are having problems with the project, please make sure that you have read the
documentation, especially [the FAQ page](faq.md). Before creating bug reports, please
also check for any similar issues or pull requests. If any of them already exists, please
participle in that one.

If you cannot determine and fix the problem yourself, please read [our guide for reporting
issues](troubleshooting.md#reporting-issues).
