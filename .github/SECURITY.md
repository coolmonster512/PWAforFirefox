## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you found a vulnerability or what you believe is a vulnerability, **do not**
open a public issue or disclose it publicly. Instead, please report them through
the [GitHub Security Advisories][github-advisories] and fill in the required
information. See the [GitHub documentation][github-documentation] for more details.

We will try to respond and release a fix as soon as possible. The vulnerability
will be made public when it is ensured that publishing it does not pose a threat
to the project and its users.

Thank you for improving the security of the project. We appreciate your efforts
and responsible disclosure!
