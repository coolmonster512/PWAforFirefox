## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you found a vulnerability or what you believe is a vulnerability, **do not**
open a public issue or disclose it publicly. Instead, report vulnerabilities to
[projects@filips.si](mailto:projects@filips.si) and include the word "SECURITY"
in the subject line. Please describe them as detailed as possible and include
how important they are, to ensure they will be fixed more easily.

We will respond to the email, and try to release a fix as soon as possible. The
vulnerability will be made public when it is ensured that publishing it does not
pose a threat to the project and its users.

Thank you for improving the security of the project. We appreciate your efforts
and responsible disclosure!
