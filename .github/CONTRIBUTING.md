Thank you very much for considering contributing to this project!

## Issue Tracker

### Bug Reports

Before creating bug reports, please check for any similar issues or
pull requests. If they are already opened, please participle in that one.

If no issues or pull requests that describe your problem exist, first try
the [troubleshooting steps](https://github.com/filips123/FirefoxPWA/wiki/Troubleshooting).
If you cannot determine and fix the problem yourself, please open a new issue
and provide all the required information. If you were able to fix the problem, but
you think the same problem might happen to other users, please report it and
include your fix, so other users can find and fix it.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.
Fill out the required template, as that information will help us resolve it faster.

If you found a vulnerability or what you believe is a vulnerability, **do not**
open a public issue or disclose it publicly. Please read our [security policy](SECURITY.md)
for more details and steps for reporting it.

### Feature Requests

Before creating feature requests, please check for any similar issues or
pull requests. If they are already opened, please participle in that one.

If no issues or pull requests that describe your request exist, please
open a new issue with the correct template. Fill the template and describe
your request, as that information will help us implement it faster.

You can also submit a pull request with the implementation.

### Discussions

For general discussions, project ideas, and support/help questions, please use
a [discussions](https://github.com/filips123/FirefoxPWA/discussions) feature
instead of the issue tracker. This will ensure the issue tracker stays clean,
so we can focus on fixing bugs and resolving feature requests.

## Pull Requests

When developing a bug fix or feature, please make sure your code adheres to
the code style and is properly linted. You can check the READMEs of the native
and extension parts for more details.

If possible, test your feature on all supported operating systems, and make
sure it works correctly. If developing a system integration, test it on multiple
desktop environments. Please also check existing features to make sure they
still work correctly.

When submitting a pull request, describe what have you done and which issues
have you fixed. Include as many useful details as possible, to make it possible
to review it quickly. If required, fix any additional requests.
